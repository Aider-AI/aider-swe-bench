To add a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we will most likely need to edit the following file:

1. `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` - This file is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and is where we would add the new shortcut.

Please add `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we will:

1. Add the new shortcut to the `addoption` method in the `Parser` class.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py`:

src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._anonymous.addoption(*opts, **attrs)
=======
        # Adding a shortcut '-c' for '--collect-only'
        if '--collect-only' in opts:
            opts = opts + ('-c',)
        self._anonymous.addoption(*opts, **attrs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will add the `-c` shortcut for the `--collect-only` option.

> Applied edit to src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py
