#### Changing user's email could invalidate password reset tokens  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Sequence:  
#### Have account with email address foo@…  
#### Password reset request for that email (unused)  
#### foo@… account changes their email address  
#### Password reset email is used  
#### The password reset email's token should be rejected at that point, but in fact it is allowed.  
#### The fix is to add the user's email address into ​PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value()  
#### Nothing forces a user to even have an email as per AbstractBaseUser. Perhaps the token generation method could be factored out onto the model, ala get_session_auth_hash().

To address the issue of invalidating password reset tokens when a user's email is changed, we need to modify the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email address in the token generation process.

The most likely file that needs to be changed is:
1. `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`

Please add `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the changes needed to include the user's email address in the token generation process:

1. Modify the `_make_hash_value` method to include the user's email address.
2. Update the docstring to reflect the new behavior.

django/contrib/auth/tokens.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
        invalidates the token.
=======
        3. The email field will change if the user's email is updated.
        Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
        invalidates the token.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/auth/tokens.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)
=======
        email_timestamp = '' if user.email is None else user.email
        return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp) + email_timestamp
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
