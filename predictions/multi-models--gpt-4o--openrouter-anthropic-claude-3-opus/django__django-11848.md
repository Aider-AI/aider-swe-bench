#### django.utils.http.parse_http_date two digit year check is incorrect  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Ad Timmering)  
#### 	   
#### RFC 850 does not mention this, but in RFC 7231 (and there's something similar in RFC 2822), there's the following quote:  
#### Recipients of a timestamp value in rfc850-date format, which uses a  
#### two-digit year, MUST interpret a timestamp that appears to be more  
#### than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in  
#### the past that had the same last two digits.  
#### Current logic is hard coded to consider 0-69 to be in 2000-2069, and 70-99 to be 1970-1999, instead of comparing versus the current year.

To address the issue with the two-digit year check in `django.utils.http.parse_http_date`, the most likely file that needs to be edited is:

- `django/utils/http.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the two-digit year check in `django.utils.http.parse_http_date`, we need to modify the logic to compare the year against the current year and adjust accordingly.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Import the `time` module to get the current year.
2. Modify the year adjustment logic to compare against the current year.

django/utils/http.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from binascii import Error as BinasciiError
=======
from binascii import Error as BinasciiError
import time
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/utils/http.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if year < 70:
                year += 2000
            else:
                year += 1900
=======
            current_year = time.gmtime().tm_year
            if year > (current_year % 100) + 50:
                year += 1900
            else:
                year += 2000
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the two-digit year is interpreted correctly according to the RFC 7231 specification.
