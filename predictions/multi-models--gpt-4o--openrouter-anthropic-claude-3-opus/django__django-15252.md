#### MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Hi,  
#### We have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following:   
#### class Router(object):  
#### 	def allow_migrate(self, db, model):  
#### 		if db == 'default':  
#### 			return True  
#### 		return False  
#### Current Behaviour  
#### We run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)  
#### When this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied).   
#### The first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish).   
#### ensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table.   
#### I believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.

To address the issue with `MigrationRecorder` not obeying `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class, which needs to be updated to respect the `allow_migrate` rules defined in the router.
2. `django/db/migrations/executor.py` - This file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class, which calls methods on `MigrationRecorder` and may need to be updated to ensure the router rules are respected.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To ensure that `MigrationRecorder` respects the `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we need to:

1. Update the `MigrationRecorder` class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to check the router rules before creating the migration table or recording migrations.
2. Update the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` to handle the case where migrations should not be recorded for certain databases.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Changes to `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`

1. Modify the `ensure_schema` method to respect the `allow_migrate` rules.
2. Modify the `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` methods to respect the `allow_migrate` rules.

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema
        # in the codebase.
        if self.has_table():
            return
        # Make the table
        try:
            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                editor.create_model(self.Migration)
        except DatabaseError as exc:
            raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
=======
        # Check if migration is allowed on this database
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema
            # in the codebase.
            if self.has_table():
                return
            # Make the table
            try:
                with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                    editor.create_model(self.Migration)
            except DatabaseError as exc:
                raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Changes to `django/db/migrations/executor.py`

1. Modify the `apply_migration` method to handle the case where migrations should not be recorded for certain databases.

django/db/migrations/executor.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if not fake:
            if fake_initial:
                # Test to see if this is an already-applied initial migration
                applied, state = self.detect_soft_applied(state, migration)
                if applied:
                    fake = True
            if not fake:
                # Alright, do it normally
                with self.connection.schema_editor(atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:
                    state = migration.apply(state, schema_editor)
                    if not schema_editor.deferred_sql:
                        self.record_migration(migration)
                        migration_recorded = True
        if not migration_recorded:
            self.record_migration(migration)
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, migration):
            if not fake:
                if fake_initial:
                    # Test to see if this is an already-applied initial migration
                    applied, state = self.detect_soft_applied(state, migration)
                    if applied:
                        fake = True
                if not fake:
                    # Alright, do it normally
                    with self.connection.schema_editor(atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:
                        state = migration.apply(state, schema_editor)
                        if not schema_editor.deferred_sql:
                            self.record_migration(migration)
                            migration_recorded = True
            if not migration_recorded:
                self.record_migration(migration)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor` classes respect the `db_router` allow_migrate rules, preventing migrations from being recorded or tables from being created on databases where migrations are not allowed.

To fix the errors, we need to import the `router` module in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
=======
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
from django.db import router
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `router` is defined and can be used in the `MigrationRecorder` class.
