#### Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Happens with Django 1.11.10  
#### Steps to reproduce:  
#### 1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together  
#### 2) Delete index_together -> Fail  
#### It will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...  
#### The worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the "new" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.  
#### I think there are 2 different points here:  
#### 1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together  
#### 2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation

To address the issue with deleting an `index_together` when there is a `unique_together` on the same fields, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

1. `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue, we need to modify the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` to handle the case where both `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints exist on the same fields.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify `_delete_composed_index` to correctly handle the case where both unique and index constraints exist on the same fields.

django/db/backends/base/schema.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))
=======
        if len(constraint_names) > 1:
            # Filter out unique constraints if we are deleting an index.
            if constraint_kwargs.get('index') and not constraint_kwargs.get('unique'):
                constraint_names = [name for name in constraint_names if not name.endswith('_uniq')]
            # Filter out index constraints if we are deleting a unique constraint.
            elif constraint_kwargs.get('unique') and not constraint_kwargs.get('index'):
                constraint_names = [name for name in constraint_names if not name.endswith('_idx')]
        
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when deleting an index or unique constraint, the method correctly identifies and handles the presence of both constraints on the same fields.
