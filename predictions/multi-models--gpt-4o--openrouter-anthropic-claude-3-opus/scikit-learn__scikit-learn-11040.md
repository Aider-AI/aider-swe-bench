To address the issue of missing parameter validation for `n_neighbors` in the `Neighbors` estimator, we will most likely need to edit the following file:

1. `sklearn/neighbors/_base.py`: This file contains the base classes for the neighbors module, including parameter validation.

Please add `sklearn/neighbors/_base.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

The files most likely to need changes to implement this feature are:

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py

Please add these files to the chat so I can suggest the necessary code changes while following the rules for *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Here are the suggested changes to validate the n_neighbors parameter in the NearestNeighbors class:

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
=======
        if n_neighbors is not None:
            if not isinstance(n_neighbors, numbers.Integral):
                raise TypeError(
                    "n_neighbors does not take %s value, "
                    "enter integer value" %
                    type(n_neighbors))
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if n_neighbors is None:
            n_neighbors = self.n_neighbors
=======
        if n_neighbors is None:
            n_neighbors = self.n_neighbors
        elif not isinstance(n_neighbors, numbers.Integral):
            raise TypeError(
                "n_neighbors does not take %s value, "
                "enter integer value" %
                type(n_neighbors))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

To make these changes, we also need to add an import statement:

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from ..exceptions import DataConversionWarning
=======
from ..exceptions import DataConversionWarning
import numbers
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will validate that n_neighbors is an integer when the NearestNeighbors object is instantiated and when the kneighbors method is called. A TypeError will be raised with a helpful message if a non-integer is passed.
