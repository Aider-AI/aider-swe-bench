#### Models migration with change field foreign to many and deleting unique together.  
#### Description

#### I have models like  
#### class Authors(models.Model):

#### 	project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.PROTECT)  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		unique_together = (('data_set', 'project'),)  
#### when i want to change field project_data_set in Authors model from foreign key field to many to many field I must delete a unique_together, cause it can't be on many to many field.  
#### Then my model should be like:

#### 	project_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(  
#### 		ProjectDataSet,  
#### 	)  
#### 	state = models.IntegerField()

#### But when I want to do a migrations.  
#### python3 manage.py makemigrations  
#### python3 manage.py migrate  
#### I have error:  
#### ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)  
#### The database is on production, so I can't delete previous initial migrations, and this error isn't depending on database, cause I delete it and error is still the same.  
#### My solve is to first delete unique_together, then do a makemigrations and then migrate. After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.  
#### But in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.  
#### I added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.

To achieve the desired changes, we will need to edit the models file where the `Authors` model is defined and create a migration file to handle the changes. The most likely files to need changes are:

1. `models.py` (where the `Authors` model is defined)
2. The migration file that will be created to handle the changes

Please add the `models.py` file to the chat.

Based on your description, I believe the following files will need to be modified to make this change:

models.py

This is where the Authors and ProjectDataSet models are defined. The project_data_set field on Authors will need to change from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField, and the unique_together constraint will need to be removed from the Authors model's Meta class.

Please add the models.py file to the chat so I can suggest the specific changes needed in a *SEARCH/REPLACE block*. I'll wait for you to provide the file before suggesting any code changes.

To address your request, we will need to modify the models and create the necessary migrations. The files that are most likely to need changes are:

1. `models.py` (where your models are defined)
2. The migration files that will be generated by Django.

Please add `models.py` to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

Based on the changes you described, the main file that will likely need to be modified is the models.py file that defines your Authors, DataSet, Project and ProjectDataSet models.

To combine the two migrations into one, you'll need to delete the unique_together constraint and change the project_data_set field from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField in the same migration.

Please add the models.py file containing those model definitions to the chat so I can provide the specific changes needed in a *SEARCH/REPLACE block*.

Based on your description, I believe the following files will need to be changed to update the Authors model:

models.py

To make the changes in a single migration, you'll need to:
1. Remove the unique_together constraint 
2. Change the project_data_set field from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField

Please add the models.py file to the chat so I can provide the exact changes needed in a *SEARCH/REPLACE block*.
