#### Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible  
#### If you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work. See below:

To implement the requested feature, we will most likely need to modify the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file. This file contains the `Point` class and its `vel` method, which is where we need to add the logic to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been defined but the position is known.

Please add the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To implement the requested feature, we need to modify the `vel` method in the `Point` class to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been defined but the position is known.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `vel` method to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been defined but the position is known.

sympy/physics/vector/point.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if not (frame in self._vel_dict):
            raise ValueError('Velocity of point ' + self.name + ' has not been'
                             ' defined in ReferenceFrame ' + frame.name)
        return self._vel_dict[frame]
=======
        if frame not in self._vel_dict:
            # Attempt to calculate the velocity if not explicitly defined
            try:
                pos = self.pos_from(Point('origin'))
                return pos.dt(frame)
            except ValueError:
                raise ValueError('Velocity of point ' + self.name + ' has not been'
                                 ' defined in ReferenceFrame ' + frame.name)
