#### Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### As pointed out by ​Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.

To log exceptions handled in `Signal.send_robust()`, we will most likely need to edit the following file:

1. `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`

Please add this file to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

To log exceptions handled in `Signal.send_robust()`, we need to:

1. Import the `logging` module.
2. Add a `logger` instance.
3. Log exceptions in the `send_robust` method.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

        # For convenience we create empty caches even if they are not used.
        # A note about caching: if use_caching is defined, then for each
        # distinct sender we cache the receivers that sender has in
        # 'sender_receivers_cache'. The cache is cleaned when .connect() or

        self.sender_receivers_cache = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary() if use_caching else {}
        self._dead_receivers = False

```python

                responses.append((receiver, err))

                self.logger.exception('Error in receiver %s', receiver)
                responses.append((receiver, err))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that exceptions raised in receivers during `send_robust()` are logged, allowing users to see such exceptions in their error handling tools.

To fix the errors identified by `flake8`, we need to:

1. Ensure that the `connect` method is properly defined.
2. Correct the scope of the `receiver` variable in the `connect` method.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to fix these issues:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __init__(self, providing_args=None, use_caching=False):

            warnings.warn(

                'comment or docstring.',

        self.sender_receivers_cache = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary() if use_caching else {}
        self._dead_receivers = False

=======
    def connect(self, receiver, sender=None, weak=True, dispatch_uid=None):
        from django.conf import settings

        # If DEBUG is on, check that we got a good receiver
        if settings.configured and settings.DEBUG:
            assert callable(receiver), "Signal receivers must be callable."

            # Check for **kwargs
            if not func_accepts_kwargs(receiver):
                raise ValueError("Signal receivers must accept keyword arguments (**kwargs).")

        if dispatch_uid:
            lookup_key = (dispatch_uid, _make_id(sender))
        else:
            lookup_key = (_make_id(receiver), _make_id(sender))

        if weak:
            ref = weakref.ref
            receiver_object = receiver
            # Check for bound methods
            if hasattr(receiver, '__self__') and hasattr(receiver, '__func__'):
                ref = weakref.WeakMethod
                receiver_object = receiver.__self__
            receiver = ref(receiver)
            weakref.finalize(receiver_object, self._remove_receiver)

        with self.lock:
            self._clear_dead_receivers()
            if not any(r_key == lookup_key for r_key, _ in self.receivers):
                self.receivers.append((lookup_key, receiver))
            self.sender_receivers_cache.clear()

```

This will ensure that the `connect` method is properly defined and that the `receiver` variable is correctly scoped within the method.

The error `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'weakref' object` indicates that the `receiver` variable is being incorrectly assigned to a `weakref` object itself, which is not allowed.

We need to ensure that `receiver` is not assigned to a `weakref` object directly. Let's correct this by properly handling the weak reference creation.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to fix this issue:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            receiver = ref(receiver)
=======
            receiver = ref(receiver_object)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `receiver` is assigned to the weak reference of `receiver_object` instead of the `weakref` object itself. This should resolve the `TypeError` and allow the tests to run successfully.

It seems that the previous fix did not resolve the issue. Let's ensure that the `receiver` is correctly handled as a weak reference. We need to make sure that the `receiver` is not directly assigned to a `weakref` object.

Here are the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            receiver = ref(receiver)
=======
            receiver = ref(receiver_object)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This should correctly handle the weak reference creation and resolve the `TypeError`. Let's proceed with this change.

#### As pointed out by ​Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers.

Based on the description, I believe the following file is most likely to need changes:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py

This file contains the Signal class which has the send_robust() method that needs to be updated to log exceptions.

> django/dispatch/dispatcher.py  
> Add these files to the chat? yes  
> 5798 prompt tokens, 241 completion tokens, $0.105045 cost  

To log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust(), we need to:

1. Import the logging module at the top of the file
2. Get a logger instance 
3. Log the exception inside the except block in send_robust()

Here are the proposed changes in *SEARCH/REPLACE* block format:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs
=======
import logging

from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs

logger = logging.getLogger('django.dispatch')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            except Exception as err:
                responses.append((receiver, err))
=======
            except Exception as err:
                logger.exception(
                    "Error calling %s in Signal.send_robust() (%s)",
                    receiver.__qualname__, err
                )
                responses.append((receiver, err))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The first block imports the logging module and gets a logger instance named 'django.dispatch'.

The second block adds a logger.exception() call inside the except block of send_robust(). This will log the exception along with the receiver details.
