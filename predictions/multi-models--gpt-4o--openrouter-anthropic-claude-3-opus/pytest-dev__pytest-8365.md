#### tmpdir creation fails when the username contains illegal characters for directory names  
#### `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory` rely on `getpass.getuser()` for determining the `basetemp` directory. I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.  
####   
#### The situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c "import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.  
####   
#### When trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:  
#### ```  
#### self = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')  
#### mode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True  
####   
####     def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):  
####         """  
####         Create a new directory at this given path.  
####         """  
####         if self._closed:  
####             self._raise_closed()  
####         try:  
#### >           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)  
#### E           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\Users\\john_doe\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pytest-of-contoso\\john_doe'  
####   
#### C:\Python38\lib\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError  
#### ```  
####   
#### I could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:  
#### ```bat  
#### echo def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py  
#### echo   pass>>test_tmp.py  
#### set LOGNAME=contoso\john_doe  
#### py.test test_tmp.py  
#### ```  
####   
#### Thanks for having a look at this!

To address the issue with illegal characters in the username returned by `getpass.getuser()`, we need to sanitize the username before using it to create directories. The most likely files that need changes are:

1. `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`
2. `src/_pytest/tmpdir_factory.py`

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with illegal characters in the username returned by `getpass.getuser()`, we need to sanitize the username before using it to create directories. We'll modify the `get_user` function to replace any illegal characters with an underscore.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `get_user` function to sanitize the username.
2. Ensure that the sanitized username is used in the `getbasetemp` method.

Let's proceed with the changes:

src/_pytest/tmpdir.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def get_user() -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work
    in the current environment (see #1010)."""
    import getpass

    try:
        return getpass.getuser()
    except (ImportError, KeyError):
        return None
=======
def get_user() -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the current user name, sanitized to be safe for directory names,
    or None if getuser() does not work in the current environment (see #1010)."""
    import getpass
    import re

    try:
        user = getpass.getuser()
        # Replace any character that is not alphanumeric or an underscore with an underscore
        return re.sub(r'[^\w]', '_', user)
    except (ImportError, KeyError):
        return None
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that any illegal characters in the username are replaced with an underscore, making it safe to use in directory names.
