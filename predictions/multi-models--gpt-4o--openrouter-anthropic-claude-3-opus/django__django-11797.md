#### Filtering on query result overrides GROUP BY of internal query  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### from django.contrib.auth import models  
#### a = models.User.objects.filter(email__isnull=True).values('email').annotate(m=Max('id')).values('m')  
#### print(a.query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email"  
#### print(a[:1].query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email" LIMIT 1  
#### b = models.User.objects.filter(id=a[:1])  
#### print(b.query) # GROUP BY U0."id" should be GROUP BY U0."email"  
#### # SELECT ... FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."id" = (SELECT U0."id" FROM "auth_user" U0 WHERE U0."email" IS NULL GROUP BY U0."id" LIMIT 1)

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause in the query, the most likely file that will need changes is:

1. `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause in the query, we need to modify the `rewrite_cols` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause is correctly set when filtering on query results.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `rewrite_cols` method to correctly set the `GROUP BY` clause.

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                new_expr, col_cnt = self.rewrite_cols(expr, col_cnt)
=======
                new_expr, col_cnt = self.rewrite_cols(expr, col_cnt)
                if isinstance(expr, Col):
                    self.group_by = (expr,)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `GROUP BY` clause is correctly set to the column being referenced, which should fix the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause in the query.

Please apply the changes and test the queries again to ensure the issue is resolved.
