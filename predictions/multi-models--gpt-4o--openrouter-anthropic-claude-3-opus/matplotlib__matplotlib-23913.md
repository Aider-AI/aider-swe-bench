#### legend draggable as keyword

#### ### Feature request  
####   
#### **There is not keyword to make legend draggable at creation**  
####   
#### <!--A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug-->  
####   
#### Is there a code reason why one can not add a "draggable=True" keyword to the __init__ function for Legend?  This would be more handy than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason why it would not work?

To add a "draggable" keyword to the `__init__` function for the Legend class, the most likely file that needs to be edited is:

1. `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add the "draggable" keyword to the `__init__` function for the Legend class, we need to:

1. Add the `draggable` parameter to the `__init__` method.
2. Update the `__init__` method to handle the `draggable` parameter.
3. Modify the `set_draggable` method to be called within the `__init__` method if `draggable` is set to `True`.

Here are the necessary changes:

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        *,
=======
        draggable=False,
        *,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._draggable = None
=======
        self._draggable = None
        if draggable:
            self.set_draggable(True)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will allow the `Legend` class to accept a `draggable` keyword argument during initialization and set the legend to be draggable if the argument is `True`.
