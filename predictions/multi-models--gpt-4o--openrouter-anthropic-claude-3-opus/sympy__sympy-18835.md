#### uniq modifies list argument  
#### When you iterate over a dictionary or set and try to modify it while doing so you get an error from Python:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> multiset('THISTLE')  
#### {'T': 2, 'H': 1, 'I': 1, 'S': 1, 'L': 1, 'E': 1}  
#### >>> for i in _:  
#### ...   _.pop(i)  
#### ...  
#### 2  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
#### RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration  
#### ```  
#### It would be good to do the same thing from within `uniq` because the output will silently be wrong if you modify a passed list:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> f=list('THISTLE')  
#### >>> for i in uniq(f):  
#### ...   f.remove(i)  
#### ...   i  
#### ...  
#### 'T'  
#### 'I'  
#### 'L'  
#### ```  
#### I think this would entail recording the size at the start and then checking the size and raising a similar RuntimeError if the size changes.

To implement the requested changes to `uniq`, the most likely file that needs to be edited is:

- `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Here are the changes needed to ensure that `uniq` raises a `RuntimeError` if the size of the list changes during iteration:

1. Record the initial size of the list.
2. Check the size of the list during iteration and raise an error if it changes.

To handle the `TypeError` when the input is a generator and to fix the `UnboundLocalError`, we need to:

1. Check if the input is a generator and handle it appropriately.
2. Ensure that the variable `s` is defined before it is used.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/utilities/iterables.py

    try:

        initial_size = len(seq)
        for i, s in enumerate(seq):
            if len(seq) != initial_size:

This change ensures that the function handles generators correctly and avoids the `UnboundLocalError`.

To fix the issues, we need to handle the cases where the input is a generator and ensure that the variable `s` is defined before it is used. Additionally, we need to handle unhashable types like lists and dictionaries.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/utilities/iterables.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def uniq(seq, result=None):
    """
    Yield unique elements from ``seq`` as an iterator. The second
    parameter ``result``  is used internally; it is not necessary to pass
    anything for this.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import uniq
    >>> dat = [1, 4, 1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 2]
    >>> type(uniq(dat)) in (list, tuple)
    False

    >>> list(uniq(dat))

#### uniq modifies list argument  
#### When you iterate over a dictionary or set and try to modify it while doing so you get an error from Python:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> multiset('THISTLE')  
#### {'T': 2, 'H': 1, 'I': 1, 'S': 1, 'L': 1, 'E': 1}  
#### >>> for i in _:  
#### ...   _.pop(i)  
#### ...  
#### 2  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
#### RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration  
#### ```  
#### It would be good to do the same thing from within `uniq` because the output will silently be wrong if you modify a passed list:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> f=list('THISTLE')  
#### >>> for i in uniq(f):  
#### ...   f.remove(i)  
#### ...   i  
#### ...  
#### 'T'  
#### 'I'  
#### 'L'  
#### ```  
#### I think this would entail recording the size at the start and then checking the size and raising a similar RuntimeError if the size changes.

Based on your request, the file that is most likely to need changes is:

sympy/utilities/iterables.py

This file contains the `uniq` function which needs to be modified to raise a `RuntimeError` if the size of the input list changes during iteration.

To make the requested changes, please add the file sympy/utilities/iterables.py to the chat.

Here are the proposed changes to sympy/utilities/iterables.py to raise a RuntimeError if the size of the input sequence changes during iteration of uniq:

sympy/utilities/iterables.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def uniq(seq, result=None):
    """
    Yield unique elements from ``seq`` as an iterator. The second
    parameter ``result``  is used internally; it is not necessary to pass
    anything for this.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> dat = [1, 4, 1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 2]
    >>> type(uniq(dat)) in (list, tuple)
    False

    >>> list(uniq(dat))
    [1, 4, 5, 2]
    >>> list(uniq(x for x in dat))
    [1, 4, 5, 2]
    >>> list(uniq([[1], [2, 1], [1]]))
    [[1], [2, 1]]

    try:

        else:
            for s in uniq(seq, result):
                yield s
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:

1. Record the initial size of `seq` in `start_size` if possible (it may be an iterator without a length).

2. Inside the loop, check if `start_size` is not None (meaning we were able to get an initial size) and if so, compare the current `len(seq)` to `start_size`. If they differ, raise a `RuntimeError`.

3. Added a `Raises` section to the docstring documenting that `uniq` may raise `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
