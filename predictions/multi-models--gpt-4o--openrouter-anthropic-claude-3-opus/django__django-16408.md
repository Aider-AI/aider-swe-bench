To address the issue with the multi-level `FilteredRelation` and `select_related()`, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

1. `django/db/models/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with multi-level `FilteredRelation` and `select_related()`, we need to ensure that the related objects are correctly set. This involves modifying the `RelatedPopulator` class to correctly handle the setting of related objects.

Here is the proposed change:

1. Modify the `RelatedPopulator` class to ensure that the `local_setter` and `remote_setter` are correctly set for multi-level `FilteredRelation`.

django/db/models/query.py
```python

class RelatedPopulator:
    """
    RelatedPopulator is used for select_related() object instantiation.

    The idea is that each select_related() model will be populated by a
    different RelatedPopulator instance. The RelatedPopulator instances get
    klass_info and select (computed in SQLCompiler) plus the used db as
    input for initialization. That data is used to compute which columns
    to use, how to instantiate the model, and how to populate the links
    between the objects.

    The actual creation of the objects is done in populate() method. This
    method gets row and from_obj as input and populates the select_related()
    model instance.
