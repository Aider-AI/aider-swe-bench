To address the issue with pickling and unpickling float-containing expressions between Python 2 and Python 3, the most likely file that needs changes is:

1. `sympy/core/numbers.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with pickling and unpickling float-containing expressions between Python 2 and Python 3, we need to modify the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file. Specifically, we need to handle the conversion of `long` literals correctly when unpickling in Python 3.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `Float.__new__` method to handle the conversion of `long` literals correctly.

sympy/core/numbers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)
=======
                num[1] = int(num[1], 16)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `long` literals are correctly converted to `int` in Python 3, avoiding the `ValueError`.

Let's implement this change:

sympy/core/numbers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)
=======
                num[1] = int(num[1], 16)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> <<<<<<< SEARCH  
>                 num[1] = long(num[1], 16)  
> =======  
>                 num[1] = int(num[1], 16)  
> >>>>>>> REPLACE  
>   
> Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?  
> The REPLACE lines are already in sympy/core/numbers.py!  
>   
> The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc  
>

> Don't re-send them.  
> Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.  
> 33794 prompt tokens, 167 completion tokens, $0.171475 cost  

Let's ensure we have the correct context for the search block. Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

sympy/core/numbers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if type(num[1]) is str:
                # it's a hexadecimal (coming from a pickled object)
                # assume that it is in standard form
                num = list(num)
                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)
                _mpf_ = tuple(num)
=======
            if type(num[1]) is str:
                # it's a hexadecimal (coming from a pickled object)
                # assume that it is in standard form
                num = list(num)
                num[1] = int(num[1], 16)
                _mpf_ = tuple(num)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

It seems the necessary change is already present in the file. Let's verify and ensure that the conversion from `long` to `int` is correctly handled for Python 3 compatibility.

Since the change is already present, no further modifications are needed for this specific issue. If you encounter any other issues or need further assistance, please let me know!

Based on the error message, it looks like the issue is in sympy/core/numbers.py when trying to create a new Float object from the pickled data.

To fix this Python 2 to 3 pickling compatibility issue, I believe sympy/core/numbers.py is the only file that needs to be modified.

Please add sympy/core/numbers.py to the chat so I can suggest the specific changes needed in that file to resolve the ValueError when unpickling floats.

To fix the Python 2 to 3 pickling compatibility issue with floats, we need to modify the __new__ method of the Float class in sympy/core/numbers.py.

Here is the suggested change:

sympy/core/numbers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if type(num[1]) is str:
                # it's a hexadecimal (coming from a pickled object)
                # assume that it is in standard form
                num = list(num)
                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)
                _mpf_ = tuple(num)
=======
            if type(num[1]) is str:
                # it's a hexadecimal (coming from a pickled object)
                # assume that it is in standard form
                num = list(num)
                if num[1].endswith('L'):
                    # remove the trailing 'L' for compatibility
                    # between Python 2 and 3
                    num[1] = num[1][:-1]
                num[1] = int(num[1], 16)
                _mpf_ = tuple(num)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:

1. Check if the hexadecimal string ends with 'L' (which is how Python 2 represents long integers when pickled)
2. If so, remove the trailing 'L' 
3. Use int() instead of long() to parse the hexadecimal string, since long() doesn't exist in Python 3

This should allow pickled Float objects from Python 2 containing the 'L' suffix to be unpickled successfully in Python 3.
