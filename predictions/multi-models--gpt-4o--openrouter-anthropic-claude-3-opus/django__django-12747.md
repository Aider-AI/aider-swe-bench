#### QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero objects deleted  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### The result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y)   
#### X - is the total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)  
#### Y - is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of deleted objects of this model).  
#### Example: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})  
#### When there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:  
#### For models with foreign keys - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})  
#### For "simple" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})  
#### I would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.

To address the inconsistency in the `QuerySet.delete` method, we will likely need to edit the following file:

1. `django/db/models/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the inconsistency in the `QuerySet.delete` method, we need to ensure that the result format is consistent, regardless of whether there are foreign key relationships involved or not. Specifically, we should ensure that the dictionary always includes model-label keys with zero values when no objects are deleted.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Modify the `delete` method to ensure the dictionary always includes model-label keys with zero values when no objects are deleted.

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return deleted, _rows_count
=======
        if not deleted:
            model_label = self.model._meta.label
            _rows_count[model_label] = _rows_count.get(model_label, 0)
        return deleted, _rows_count
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the dictionary always includes model-label keys with zero values when no objects are deleted, making the result format consistent.
