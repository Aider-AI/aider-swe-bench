#### Add easily comparable version info to toplevel  
#### <!--  
#### Welcome! Thanks for thinking of a way to improve Matplotlib.  
####   
####   
#### Before creating a new feature request please search the issues for relevant feature requests.  
#### -->  
####   
#### ### Problem  
####   
#### Currently matplotlib only exposes `__version__`.  For quick version checks, exposing either a `version_info` tuple (which can be compared with other tuples) or a `LooseVersion` instance (which can be properly compared with other strings) would be a small usability improvement.  
####   
#### (In practice I guess boring string comparisons will work just fine until we hit mpl 3.10 or 4.10 which is unlikely to happen soon, but that feels quite dirty :))  
#### <!--  
#### Provide a clear and concise description of the problem this feature will solve.   
####   
#### For example:  
#### * I'm always frustrated when [...] because [...]  
#### * I would like it if [...] happened when I [...] because [...]  
#### * Here is a sample image of what I am asking for [...]  
#### -->  
####   
#### ### Proposed Solution  
####   
#### I guess I slightly prefer `LooseVersion`, but exposing just a `version_info` tuple is much more common in other packages (and perhaps simpler to understand).  The hardest(?) part is probably just bikeshedding this point :-)  
#### <!-- Provide a clear and concise description of a way to accomplish what you want. For example:  
####   
#### * Add an option so that when [...]  [...] will happen  
####  -->  
####   
#### ### Additional context and prior art  
####   
#### `version_info` is a pretty common thing (citation needed).  
#### <!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. You can also include links to examples of other programs that have something similar to your request. For example:

#### * Another project [...] solved this by [...]

To add easily comparable version info to the top level, the most likely file that needs to be edited is:

1. `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add easily comparable version info to the top level, we will:

1. Define a `version_info` tuple.
2. Optionally, define a `LooseVersion` instance for more advanced version comparisons.

Here are the changes:

lib/matplotlib/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def __getattr__(name):
=======
from distutils.version import LooseVersion

__version__ = _version.version
version_info = tuple(map(int, __version__.split('.')[:3]))
__loose_version__ = LooseVersion(__version__)

def __getattr__(name):
    if name == "version_info":
        return version_info
    if name == "__loose_version__":
        return __loose_version__
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will expose `version_info` and `__loose_version__` at the top level, making it easy to perform version comparisons.

> Applied edit to lib/matplotlib/__init__.py
