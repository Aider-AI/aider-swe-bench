#### ExpressionWrapper for ~Q(pk__in=[]) crashes.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Stefan Brand)  
#### 	   
#### Problem Description  
#### I'm reducing some Q objects (similar to what is described in ticket:32554. Everything is fine for the case where the result is ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[])). However, when I reduce to ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[])) the query breaks.  
#### Symptoms  
#### Working for ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[]))  
#### print(queryset.annotate(foo=ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[]), output_field=BooleanField())).values("foo").query)  
#### SELECT 0 AS "foo" FROM "table"  
#### Not working for ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]))  
#### print(queryset.annotate(foo=ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]), output_field=BooleanField())).values("foo").query)  
#### SELECT AS "foo" FROM "table"

To address the issue with `ExpressionWrapper` and `~Q(pk__in=[])`, the most likely file that needs to be edited is:

- `django/db/models/expressions.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with `ExpressionWrapper` and `~Q(pk__in=[])`, we need to ensure that the `ExpressionWrapper` can handle negated `Q` objects properly. This involves modifying the `as_sql` method of the `ExpressionWrapper` class to handle the negation correctly.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Modify the `as_sql` method of the `ExpressionWrapper` class to handle the negation of `Q` objects.

django/db/models/expressions.py
<source>python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        return compiler.compile(self.expression)
=======
    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        sql, params = compiler.compile(self.expression)
        if isinstance(self.expression, Q) and self.expression.negated:
            sql = 'NOT (%s)' % sql
        return sql, params
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

This change ensures that when the `ExpressionWrapper` contains a negated `Q` object, the SQL generated will correctly include the `NOT` keyword.

> Applied edit to django/db/models/expressions.py
