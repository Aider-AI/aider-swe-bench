To address the issue with `coth(log(tan(x))).subs(x, 2)`, the most likely file that needs to be edited is:

- `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the `NameError: name 'cotm' is not defined` issue in `coth(log(tan(x))).subs(x, 2)`, we need to correct the variable name in the `coth` class's `eval` method.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:
=======
                    if cothm is S.ComplexInfinity:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the correct variable `cothm` is used in the condition.
