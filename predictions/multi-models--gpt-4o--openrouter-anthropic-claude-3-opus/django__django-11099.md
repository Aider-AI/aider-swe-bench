#### UsernameValidator allows trailing newline in usernames  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator use the regex   
#### r'^[\w.@+-]+$'  
#### The intent is to only allow alphanumeric characters as well as ., @, +, and -. However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \A and \Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to  
#### r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'  
#### in order to reject usernames that end with a newline.  
#### I am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.

To address the issue with the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` allowing trailing newlines in usernames, we need to modify the regex patterns in the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file.

Please add the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to the `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` file to update the regex patterns for `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`:

django/contrib/auth/validators.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/auth/validators.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    regex = r'^[\w.@+-]+$'
=======
    regex = r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/contrib/auth/validators.py
