#### QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Considering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example:   
#### Company.objects.only("name").defer("name")  
#### loads all the fields with the following query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."name", "company"."trade_number", "company"."country" FROM "company"  
#### and   
#### Company.objects.only("name").defer("name").defer("country")  
#### also loads all the fields with the same query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."name", "company"."trade_number", "company"."country" FROM "company"  
#### In those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:  
#### SELECT "company"."id" FROM "company"  
#### In the following example, we get the expected behavior:  
#### Company.objects.only("name", "country").defer("name")  
#### only loads "id" and "country" fields with the following query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."country" FROM "company"

To address the issue with `QuerySet.defer()` not clearing deferred fields when chaining with `only()`, the most likely file that will need changes is:

1. `django/db/models/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue where `QuerySet.defer()` does not clear deferred fields when chaining with `only()`, we need to modify the `defer` and `only` methods in `django/db/models/query.py`.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `defer` method to clear deferred fields when chaining with `only`.
2. Ensure that the `only` method properly handles the deferred fields.

Let's implement these changes:

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if fields == (None,):
            clone.query.clear_deferred_loading()
        else:
            clone.query.add_deferred_loading(fields)
        return clone

    def only(self, *fields):
        """
        Essentially, the opposite of defer(). Only the fields passed into this
        method and that are not already specified as deferred are loaded
        immediately when the queryset is evaluated.
        """
        self._not_support_combined_queries('only')
        if self._fields is not None:
            raise TypeError("Cannot call only() after .values() or .values_list()")
        if fields == (None,):
            # Can only pass None to defer(), not only(), as the rest option.
            # That won't stop people trying to do this, so let's be explicit.
            raise TypeError("Cannot pass None as an argument to only().")
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:
                raise ValueError('only() is not supported with FilteredRelation.')
        clone = self._chain()
        clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)
        return clone
=======
        if self._fields is not None:
            raise TypeError("Cannot call defer() after .values() or .values_list()")
        clone = self._chain()
        if fields == (None,):
            clone.query.clear_deferred_loading()
        else:
            clone.query.add_deferred_loading(fields)
        return clone

    def only(self, *fields):
        """
        Essentially, the opposite of defer(). Only the fields passed into this
        method and that are not already specified as deferred are loaded
        immediately when the queryset is evaluated.
        """
        self._not_support_combined_queries('only')
        if self._fields is not None:
            raise TypeError("Cannot call only() after .values() or .values_list()")
        if fields == (None,):
            # Can only pass None to defer(), not only(), as the rest option.
            # That won't stop people trying to do this, so let's be explicit.
            raise TypeError("Cannot pass None as an argument to only().")
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:
                raise ValueError('only() is not supported with FilteredRelation.')
        clone = self._chain()
        clone.query.clear_deferred_loading()
        clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)
        return clone
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when `only()` is called, it clears any deferred fields set by `defer()`, and then adds the immediate loading fields. This should resolve the issue where `defer()` does not clear deferred fields when chaining with `only()`.

To address the failing test `test_defer_only_chaining`, we need to ensure that the `defer` and `only` methods interact correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that `defer` properly respects the fields specified in `only`.

Let's modify the `defer` method to handle this correctly:

django/db/models/query.py
```python

            clone.query.clear_deferred_loading()
        else:

        return clone

    def only(self, *fields):
        """
        Essentially, the opposite of defer(). Only the fields passed into this
        method and that are not already specified as deferred are loaded
        immediately when the queryset is evaluated.
        """
        self._not_support_combined_queries('only')
        if self._fields is not None:
            raise TypeError("Cannot call only() after .values() or .values_list()")
        if fields == (None,):
            # Can only pass None to defer(), not only(), as the rest option.
            # That won't stop people trying to do this, so let's be explicit.
            raise TypeError("Cannot pass None as an argument to only().")
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:
                raise ValueError('only() is not supported with FilteredRelation.')
        clone = self._chain()

        if fields == (None,):
            # Can only pass None to defer(), not only(), as the rest option.
            # That won't stop people trying to do this, so let's be explicit.
            raise TypeError("Cannot pass None as an argument to only().")
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:

This change ensures that when `only()` is called, it clears any deferred fields set by `defer()`, and then adds the immediate loading fields. This should resolve the issue where `defer()` does not clear deferred fields when chaining with `only()`.

It appears that the previous search block did not match exactly. Let's try again with a more precise match.

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if fields == (None,):

#### QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Considering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example:   
#### Company.objects.only("name").defer("name")  
#### loads all the fields with the following query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."name", "company"."trade_number", "company"."country" FROM "company"  
#### and   
#### Company.objects.only("name").defer("name").defer("country")  
#### also loads all the fields with the same query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."name", "company"."trade_number", "company"."country" FROM "company"  
#### In those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:  
#### SELECT "company"."id" FROM "company"  
#### In the following example, we get the expected behavior:  
#### Company.objects.only("name", "country").defer("name")  
#### only loads "id" and "country" fields with the following query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."country" FROM "company"

To fix the issue with QuerySet.defer() not clearing deferred fields when chaining with only(), we need to modify the add_deferred_loading() method in django/db/models/query.py.

Here are the proposed changes in a *SEARCH/REPLACE block*:

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def add_deferred_loading(self, field_names):
        """
        Add the given list of model field names to the set of fields to
        exclude from loading from the database when automatic column selection
        is done. Add the new field names to any existing field names that
        are deferred (or removed from any existing field names that are marked
        as the only ones for immediate loading).
        """
        # Fields on related models are stored in the literal double-underscore
        # format, so that we can use a set datastructure. We do the foo__bar
        # splitting and handling when computing the SQL column names (as part of
        # get_columns()).
        existing, defer = self.deferred_loading
        if defer:
            # Add to existing deferred names.

```

The key changes are:

1. Convert the `field_names` parameter to a set to avoid duplicates.

2. Check if 'pk' is in `field_names`. If so, remove it and add the actual primary key field name instead. This ensures consistency.

3. When `defer` is False (meaning we are in `only()` mode), instead of removing the `field_names` from the existing immediate load fields, we completely replace the immediate load fields with `field_names`. This ensures that `only()` followed by `defer()` results in loading only the non-deferred fields.

With these changes, the behavior of chaining `only()` and `defer()` should be fixed to produce the expected SQL queries and loaded fields.
