#### translation.E004 shouldn't be raised on sublanguages when a base language is available.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### According to Django documentation:  
#### If a base language is available but the sublanguage specified is not, Django uses the base language. For example, if a user specifies de-at (Austrian German) but Django only has de available, Django uses de.  
#### However, when using Django 3.0.2, if my settings.py has  
#### LANGUAGE_CODE = "de-at"  
#### I get this error message:  
#### SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:  
#### ERRORS:  
#### ?: (translation.E004) You have provided a value for the LANGUAGE_CODE setting that is not in the LANGUAGES setting.  
#### If using  
#### LANGUAGE_CODE = "es-ar"  
#### Django works fine (es-ar is one of the translations provided out of the box).

To address the issue with `translation.E004` being raised for sublanguages when a base language is available, we will likely need to modify the file responsible for the translation checks.

The most likely file to need changes is:
- `django/core/checks/translation.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To address the issue with `translation.E004` being raised for sublanguages when a base language is available, we need to modify the `check_language_settings_consistent` function in `django/core/checks/translation.py`. Specifically, we will add logic to check if the base language is available when the sublanguage is not.

Here are the changes:

1. Split the `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` to check for the base language.
2. Update the condition to include a check for the base language.

django/core/checks/translation.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} | {'en-us'}
    if settings.LANGUAGE_CODE not in available_tags:
=======
    available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} | {'en-us'}
    language_code = settings.LANGUAGE_CODE
    base_language_code = language_code.split('-')[0]
    if language_code not in available_tags and base_language_code not in available_tags:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
    return []
```

This change ensures that if the sublanguage specified in `LANGUAGE_CODE` is not available, Django will check if the base language is available before raising the `E004` error.
