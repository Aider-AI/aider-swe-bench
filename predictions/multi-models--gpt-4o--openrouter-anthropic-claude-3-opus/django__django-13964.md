#### Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Charlie DeTar)  
#### 	   
#### Given a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:  
#### class Product(models.Model):  
#### 	sku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)  
#### class Order(models.Model):  
#### 	product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  
#### If the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not "see" the primary key's change:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product()  
#### 	order.product.sku = "foo"  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product_id="").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails  
#### Instead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku="" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.  
#### On the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product(sku="foo")  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds  
#### Committing the transaction also succeeds.  
#### This may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.

To address the issue described, we likely need to make changes in the following files:

1. `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`: This file handles the assignment of related objects to fields, which is where the issue with the primary key not being updated correctly might be occurring.
2. `django/db/models/base.py`: This file handles the saving of model instances, which might need adjustments to ensure the primary key is correctly set before saving.

Please add `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` and `django/db/models/base.py` to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue of data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys, we need to ensure that the primary key is correctly set before saving the parent object. This involves changes in both `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`.

### Changes in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`

1. Update the `__set__` method in `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` to ensure the primary key is set correctly before saving the parent object.

### Changes in `django/db/models/base.py`

1. Update the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method to handle non-numeric primary keys correctly.

The errors indicate that the primary key is not being set correctly before saving the parent object. We need to ensure that the primary key is set before assigning the related object to the parent.

Let's update the `__set__` method in `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` and the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method in `Model` to handle this correctly.

Here are the updated *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

#### `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`

```python
django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py

These changes should ensure that the primary key is correctly set before saving the parent object, preventing data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys. Please run the tests again to verify the changes.

#### class Order(models.Model):  
#### 	product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  
#### If the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not "see" the primary key's change:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product()  
#### 	order.product.sku = "foo"  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product_id="").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails  
#### Instead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku="" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.  
#### On the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product(sku="foo")  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds  
#### Committing the transaction also succeeds.  
#### This may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.

Based on the description, the most likely file that would need changes to fix this issue is:

django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py

This file contains the descriptor classes for related fields like ForeignKey. The logic for handling saving of related objects and populating the foreign key values on the parent model would be located here.

To investigate further and propose a fix, please add the django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py file to the chat.

Here is a proposed change to fix the issue of saving a parent object with a non-numeric primary key child leading to data loss:

django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            for lh_field, rh_field in self.field.related_fields:
                setattr(instance, lh_field.attname, getattr(value, rh_field.attname))
=======
            for lh_field, rh_field in self.field.related_fields:
                rh_val = getattr(value, rh_field.attname)
                if rh_val != getattr(value, rh_field.name):
                    # If the primary key has been modified, and differs from
                    # the raw field value, use the primary key's value instead.
                    rh_val = getattr(value, rh_field.name)
                setattr(instance, lh_field.attname, rh_val)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:

1. Get the current value of the child's primary key field using `getattr(value, rh_field.name)` in addition to the raw database value from `getattr(value, rh_field.attname)`.

2. Compare these two values. If they differ, it means the primary key has been modified on the child instance after it was created. 

3. In that case, use the current value of the primary key (`rh_val = getattr(value, rh_field.name)`) when setting the foreign key value on the parent instance, rather than the original raw value.

This should ensure that when saving the parent instance, it will use the updated primary key value from the child, even if that child was first assigned to the parent when its primary key was unset or different.

Let me know if you would like me to explain the change further or have any other questions!
