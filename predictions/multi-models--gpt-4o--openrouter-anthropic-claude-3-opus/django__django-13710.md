#### Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Django allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.  
#### I have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.

To implement this change, the most likely files that will need to be edited are:

1. `django/contrib/admin/options.py` - This file contains the `InlineModelAdmin` class where we need to set the default `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name`.
2. `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py` - This file should contain the tests for admin inlines where we can add the necessary tests to ensure the new behavior works as expected.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Let's start by updating the `InlineModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to set the default `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if it is specified.

Then, we will add tests in `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py` to ensure this new behavior works as expected.

Here are the changes:

### Update `InlineModelAdmin` class

django/contrib/admin/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
=======
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            if self.verbose_name:
                self.verbose_name_plural = format_lazy('{}s', self.verbose_name)
            else:
                self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Add tests for the new behavior

tests/admin_inlines/tests.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def test_both_verbose_names_inline(self):
=======
    def test_inline_verbose_name_plural_default(self):
        class CustomVerboseNameInline(TabularInline):
            model = Profile
            verbose_name = 'Custom Verbose Name'

        modeladmin = ModelAdmin(ProfileCollection, admin_site)
        modeladmin.inlines = [CustomVerboseNameInline]
        obj = ProfileCollection.objects.create()
        url = reverse('admin:admin_inlines_profilecollection_change', args=(obj.pk,))
        request = self.factory.get(url)
        request.user = self.superuser
        response = modeladmin.changeform_view(request)
        self.assertContains(response, '<h2>Custom Verbose Names</h2>')
        self.assertContains(response, 'Add another Custom Verbose Name')

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `verbose_name_plural` for an `Inline` class is based on the specified `verbose_name` if it is provided. The new test will verify this behavior.
